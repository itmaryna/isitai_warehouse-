      "description": "A work that likely sits in an early-1900s transitional phase, where mood, simplified forms, and restrained palettes were commonly used to convey psychological tone.",

      "curiousFact": "Cubism’s still-life tradition often used newspapers and bottle labels because typography instantly anchors the viewer in “real life,” even when the forms are abstracted.",

      "description": "A figurative scene centered on childhood play, typically read through gesture and posture more than strict realism; the emphasis is on mood and movement.",
      "curiousFact": "Many mid-century works treat children as a way to explore spontaneity—artists often loosen technique to match the subject’s energy.",
